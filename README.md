# GHCI' 20 Codeathon
> [Link To the final Deployed Application(Integration of chat app and recommender system along with the full stack web app](https://youngold-app.herokuapp.com/)

## Team: BrainStabilizer
### Web App Name: YounGold

```
PROBLEM STATEMENT:Provide solutions for post-COVID-19 life
SOLUTION: Built by team Brainstabilizer

A Social networking application named as YOUNGOLD to connect all people of different age groups
specially connecting Young one with Old one to solve problems because of
which people are stressed and depressed.

PROPOSED SOLUTION:
In Post Covid life people will be facing mental health issues due to selfisolation,financial crisis, career uncertainty social- distancing, fear,anxiety, etc.There are many people who are struggling and wish to share their problems with the people who have faced similar problems and are experienced in their field of interest to seek for guidance andcareer paths. Also,There are many elderly retired professionals who arefacing loneliness in this Pandemic and who have ample time and wish to guide young people in their spare time.

```

# Prerequisite

```bash
There are two additional folder that you need to extract while setting it up locally ,

1.YounGold (Recommender system folder)
2.YounGold-Chat-Application (For communication purpose folder)
Run both these folder seperately

NOTE:Readme for running both this folder seperately in your local system is available inside it.
 ```
#### Except these two, below are the instruction to run the full stack website in your local system.
 
##### You are good to go now :)

## Packages must be installed before start writing the code


```bash
npm init
```

```bash
npm i express express-validator bcryptjs config gravator jsonwebtoken mongoose request
 ```

 ```bash
 npm i -D nodemon concurrently
 ```

**Chages should be made in package.json** Instead of **test** in package.json write this :

```bash
"start": "node server",
"server": "nodemon server"
```

### For Front end part using react in client folder

Create a folder inside your root project named **client**.
Go to the client folder by,

```bash
cd client
```

Create a react app using this cmd,

```bash
npx create-react-app client
```

After that, try to open the development server

```bash
npm start

```

and if everything work fine and server gets open then close it using **ctrl+c** and install few packages, inside client folder only

```bash
npm i axios react-router-dom redux react-redux redux-thunk redux-devtools-extension moment react-moment
```

## Changes to GitHub API authentication :octopus:


GitHub has [depreciated authentication via URL query parameters](https://developer.github.com/changes/2019-11-05-deprecated-passwords-and-authorizations-api/#authenticating-using-query-parameters)
You can get an access token by following [these instructions](https://help.github.com/en/github/authenticating-to-github/creating-a-personal-access-token-for-the-command-line)
For this app we don't need to add any permissions so don't select any in the _scopes_.
**DO NOT SHARE ANY TOKENS THAT HAVE PERMISSIONS**
This would leave your account or repositories vulnerable, depending on permissions set.

It would also be worth adding your `default.json` config file to `.gitignore`
If git has been previously tracking your `default.json` file then...

```bash
git rm --cached config/default.json
```

Then add your token to the config file and confirm that the file is untracked with `git status` before pushing to GitHub.
GitHub does have your back here though. If you accidentally push code to a repository that contains a valid access token, GitHub will revoke that token.

# Quick Start :atom_symbol:

### Add a default.json file in config folder with the following

```
{
  "mongoURI": "<your_mongoDB_Atlas_uri_with_credentials>",
  "jwtSecret": "secret",
  "githubToken": "<yoursecrectaccesstoken>"
}
```

### Install server dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

### Install client dependencies

```bash
cd client
npm install
```

### Run both Express & React from root

```bash
npm run dev
```

### Deploy to Heroku :cloud:	

If you followed the sensible advice above and included `config/default.json` `and config/production.json` in your .gitignore file, then pushing to Heroku will omit your config files from the push.  
However, Heroku needs these files for a successful build.  
So how to get them to Heroku without commiting them to GitHub?

What I suggest you do is create a local only branch, lets call it _production_.

```bash
git checkout -b production
```

We can use this branch to deploy from, with our config files.

Add the config file...

```bash
git add -f config/production.json
```

This will track the file in git on this branch only. **DON'T PUSH THE PRODUCTION BRANCH TO GITHUB**

Commit...

```bash
git commit -m 'ready to deploy'
```

Create your Heroku project

```bash
heroku create [Appname]
```

And push the local production branch to the remote heroku master branch.

```bash
git push heroku production:master
```

Now Heroku will have the config it needs to build the project.

> **Don't forget to make sure your production database is not whitelisted in MongoDB Atlas, otherwise the database connection will fail and your app will crash.**

After deployment you can delete the production branch if you like.

```bash
git checkout master
git branch -D production
```

Or you can leave it to merge and push updates from another branch.  
Make any changes you need on your master branch and merge those into your production branch.

```bash
git checkout production
git merge master
```

Once merged you can push to heroku as above and your site will rebuild and be updated ready.

## Run both Express & React from root :heavy_check_mark:

Now you can run from root of your project using command

```bash
npm run dev
```

This will run both your server and development environment too.
and you're good to go :)

```bash
This full Stack App has integrated with the other two App as well, i.e
1.Chat App and
2.Recommender System
Here you go :)
```
